# 👋 Hi, I’m Bradley

> Building apps. Breaking apps. Securing apps. ☕💻🔐

I’m an **aspiring Application Security Engineer** and **Full-Stack Developer** who enjoys understanding how systems work — and how they break — so I can build them better and safer.

I like my code clean, my attack surfaces small, and my coffee warm.
